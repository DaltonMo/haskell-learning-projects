# 🧠 Haskell Learning Projects

A collection of small, focused Haskell programs created to explore functional programming concepts, practice idiomatic Haskell, and build command-line utilities. Each project targets specific language features and problem-solving strategies.

## 🔍 Why This Repository Matters

This repository demonstrates a growing mastery of Haskell through hands-on projects. Each program is designed to reinforce key skills relevant to real-world functional development, including:

- Writing pure and composable functions
- Handling IO safely and idiomatically
- Pattern matching and algebraic data types
- Structuring small CLI applications
- Developing modular, maintainable Haskell code

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Haskell
- **Tools:** GHC, VSCode with Haskell plugins
- **Concepts:** Functional programming, recursion, pattern matching, IO monad, type inference

## 📂 Current Projects

### ✅ `unit-converter`

A terminal-based program that converts between various units (inches/cm, lbs/kg, Fahrenheit/Celsius). Focuses on arithmetic logic, IO, and `case` expressions.  
➡️ [View Project](./unit-converter)

### ✅ `student-grade-tracker`

Analyzes a list of students and their grades to determine the top performer. Demonstrates recursive list processing, data types, and custom logic for average calculation.  
➡️ [View Project](./student-grade-tracker)

## 🚀 How to Run Projects

Navigate to the project file and compile using GHC:

```bash
ghc main.hs -o main
./main
```

📌 _Requires GHC (The Glasgow Haskell Compiler). You can install it via [Haskell GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)._

## 📘 What I’m Practicing

- Functional decomposition and immutability
- Working with Haskell’s type system
- User input/output via the `IO` monad
- Creating maintainable, standalone CLI tools
- Understanding Haskell compilation and toolchain
