# 🧠 Student Grade Tracker (Haskell)

A Haskell program that models student grade data and determines which student has the highest average. It uses recursive functions and custom data types to perform the analysis.

## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

This project showcases key Haskell features used in data analysis tasks, such as:

- Defining and manipulating custom types (`Student`)
- Recursion over lists to compute aggregate values
- Pattern matching and guards for control flow
- Functional techniques for finding maximum values

These skills are foundational for writing clean, declarative Haskell code — especially in scenarios involving records, list processing, and program logic without imperative constructs.
